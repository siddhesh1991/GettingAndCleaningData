The Data that was used can be found here: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

### Project Summary
The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

### Additional Information
`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps.
